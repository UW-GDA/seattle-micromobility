## 1. Summary
This project investigates **micromobility usage**-specifically e-scooters and bike share in Seattle. Our primary focus is to understand **where** and **when** people ride, locate potential **collision hotspots** involving vulnerable road users (pedestrians, cyclists, e-scooter riders), and examine **geographic factors** (like slope, transit proximity, land use) that may influence both usage and collisions. We hope these insights will guide data-driven enhancements to infrastructure, user behavior, and environmental considerations- ultimately fostering safer and more sustainable micromobility adoption.

## 2. Introductory Background

Seattle has rapidly expanded its micromobility offerings (e-scooters, bike shares) to provide **low-emission**, last-mile travel solutions. For example, **Seattle's e-scooter pilot program** recorded over **1.4 millions rides** between 2020 and 2021 (Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT), 2021). Meanwhile, a **2022 study by the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO)** found that micromobility devices can replace up to **30% of short car trips** in dense urban areas, emphasizing their role in reducing vehicle miles traveled (NACTO, 2022). However, questions about **safety** and **usage distribution** persist. According to **SDOT collision data**, **21% of reported e-scooter crashes** in 2021 led to serious injuries-indicating the need for improved infrastructure and rider education (SDOT, 2022). Additionally, **steep slopes**, **uneven access to protected lanes**, and **transit deserts** may further complicate safe micromobility usage for residents in certain neighborhoods (King County Mobility Coalition, 2020)
By merging **trip data** (where and when people ride) with **collision records** and relevant **geospatial layers** (slope, transit stops, land-use types), we aim to

- Pinpoint **high-usage corridors** and **collision hotspots**
- Explore **geographic influences** (e.g., terrain, neighborhood zoning) on ridership and collisions

## 3. Problem Statement & Objectives

**Problem Statement**
1. **Where** do e-scooter and bike share trips cluster, and do these align with collision-prone zones?
2. **How** do factors like slope, proximity to transit, or land use affect micromobility usage and collision risk?

**Objectives**
1. **Spatiotemporal Patterns**
    - Identify ridership peaks (daily/weekly/seasonal) and produce usage hotspot maps.
2. **Collision Hotspots**
    - Detect VRU collision clusters using kernel density or Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) to compare with usage patterns.
3. **Geographic Factors**
    - Integrate slope or land-use data to see how terrain/environment shapes micromobility usage and collisions.

## 6. Methodology & Approach

**Spatiotemporal Patterns**: Bikeshare counter data was plotted on maps by Seattle neighborhood and turned into animations to show bikeshare changes over time. Scooter and bike distribbutions were plotted using Kernel Density Estimation to find micromobility use hotspots. This data was also used to do a time series analysis per hour and per day to find patterns in usage.

**Collision Hotspots**: A large part of the collision analysis was cleaning the datasets. This included dropping unnecessary columns and duplications, handling missing data, converting date-time data, and converting the CRS. Exploratory data analysis was done by year to show the number of collisions (along with person count, injuries, etc.) per year. The cleaned data was also used to determine distribution of micromobility collision severity by year. Collisions were plotted on a map and made into a Kernal Density Estimation to find collision hotspots. 

**Geospatial Correlation**:
Geospatial correlation methods were split into 2 main parts: raster manipulation and road zonal stats. Firstly, a full Seattle DTM raster was created from smaller raster sets provided by King County. From this a slope raster was created and used to calculate zonal stats for roads in U District and Downtown. The stats showed the mean slope of those roads and highlighted where slopes were greatest using plots.
